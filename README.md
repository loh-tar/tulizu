**tulizu** is a pure bash script to view and switch getty issue files.
Furthermore it may helpful at the creation process of such an issue file when
there are ASCII arts included.

For this purpose **tulizu** uses its own tizu file format which allows to set
options for different kind of resulting issue file.

**tulizu** is shipped with a modest collection of ASCII art issue/tizu files
ready to use for Arch Linux users and some samples for other systems.

You are cordially invited to include _your_ fancy issue/tizu file to **tulizu**
to help to build a nice data base of issue/tizu files.

It's name, if it is not clear, is a quibble of 'issue tool' and is in such to be
pronounced contracted like 'toolishoo'.

**Last version is 0.2 released Okt, 2017**
