1- Introduction
=================
tulizu is a pure bash script to view and switch Unix issue files.
Furthermore it may helpful at the creation process of such an issue file when
there are ASCII-Arts included.

tulizu is shipped with a modest collection of ASCII art issue/tizu files ready
to use for Arch Linux users and some samples for other systems.

You are cordially invited to include your fancy issue/tizu file to tulizu!

It's name, if it is not clear, is a quibble of 'issue tool' and is in such to be
pronounced contracted like 'toolishoo'.


2- Challenge
==============
Unix issue files, delivered by [foo]getty, usually contain so called 'issue
escapes' which are noted in usual escape manna by a preceding backslash. These
makes the creation or view of ASCII art included issue files not easier. At this
point comes tulizu in.


3- Use Cases
==============
I think there is no need to explain each command in detail. tulizu report by
help command all what he knows and expect, but you find some notes below.


3-1- Benefit Usage
-------------------
Run the commands 'list' to view the shipped issue files and 'install' to take
effect, that's it. To make it easier for you, here are some steps how to get
started: Let's assume you are looking for an Arch file...

  $ tulizu list arch

You got a surprising long list. Read careful. Now you can filter these list even
more, e.g. by add 'logo' to the pattern...

  $ tulizu list arch.logo

The list got much shorter. To get more details about each file, add the info
sub-command...

  $ tulizu list arch.logo info

No big surprise, you see more information. But a picture says more than 1000
words. So replace info by show command...

  $ tulizu list arch.logo show

Yeah! That's better! Let's assume you have a favorite, then you will enhance the
search pattern until only this one is shown, e.g...

  $ tulizu list arch.logo.cond show

OK. But your prefer less colors, so you try an option or two...

  $ tulizu list arch.logo.cond show c3 m3

You play around with pattern and options and want finally use the one you have
last shown. Then you run...

  $ tulizu install

Switch to some free tty. If there is no effect, logging in and out may do the
trick. Have fun!


3-2- Converting ASCII-Art
---------------------------
If you have made an ASCII-Art with an editor like aewan you can convert it by
using the 'make' command.


3-3- Notes To Commands
------------------------
install
  Install is save in a way that the existing issue file is moved as backup to
  /etc/issue.saved-by-tulizu and can be at anytime restored. The backup is
  created only if it not already exist, so you can try as many as you like
  without to lose your original file.

show
  When you view a file containing a clear screen sequence is these removed
  before displaying.

make
  When you specify an not known option is a warning printed, but if you specify
  an undefined number to an option is not. The behavior depends then on the
  respective option. In case of colors cN will be all colors removed, which is
  quite useful. In case of razors zN, will nothing be cut, which is perfectly
  appropriate. But in the case of any other custom option, any line containing
  that tag will be removed in the resulting file, which may look surprisingly
  interesting, but in most cases rather ugly.


4- tizu File Format
======================
Besides of using an ASCII-Art editor you can edit to, or create from scratch, a
so called tizu-file. Look at the example, or the others shipped with tulizu at
/usr/share/tulizu/tizu, how it looks.

tulizu parses any file by the 'make' command for its own tags. These tags
consist of a colon : followed by the letters tu and usually ends with a colon.

Empty lines will always removed from the generated issue file.

Only for completeness: 'tizu' is short for 'tulizu izu' :-)


4-1- tizu File Name
---------------------
From a technical point of view, of course, it doesn't matter what the file is
called, but since the list command search and filter for the file name, it is
useful to have all files follow a certain pattern.

  <system/distribution>-<size>-logo-<type>-<size>-lettering-<type>.tizu

A <size> is relative, of course, but let's put it this way:

  Logo height       Wording
     1-6              small
    7-10              No extra size, just logo
    11-15             medium
    16-20             large
    21-               huge

  Lettering height  Wording
     1-3              small
     4-6              No extra size, just lettering
     7-8              medium
     9-13             large
    14-               huge

However, even more important than this rather rough naming scheme is that each
individual file can be selected unambiguously. For this reason, type is there
above. Type can be anything that makes sense, resulting in e.g.:

  logo-simple, logo-dots, johns-logo, pauls-logo, beastie-logo

With the lettering, it is particularly useful to specify the used font or if you
have something modified describe the change, e.g.:

  Doh-lettering, lettering-condensed, lettering-wide

And finally, you can add any kind of additional attribute or author name if no
unique name has yet been found.


4-2- tizu File Tags
---------------------
:tu# Author=<name>
  You've probably guessed it. Place here what ever you like, your full name,
  only a nick, e-mail or combinations of these. If your work is based on some
  one else, add a hint too

:tu# Desc=<description>
  The Description-Tag should describe in ~80 chars the big picture with as much
  detail as possible, but without mentioning anything unimportant or redundant

:tu#
  The Comment-Tag. The line will entirely removed. There is no end colon needed.
  Many of the other tags looks in front as this Comment-Tag, do not be confused!
  Use it also to add more credits, like where you found the art, or what tools
  you have used to create this file, e.g. what FIGlet font do we see or what
  ASCII editor/converter was used. Maybe this way someone will be inspired to
  create something new

:tu# <c><n>:
  The Option-Tag is removed in place by make command when the option <c><n> was
  given, or is kept in place until Comment-Tags will processed :-)

:tu# <c><n>=<hint>
  The Option-Description-Tag with a hint for the user

:tu# Opt:<c>=<name>
  The Option-Name-Tag introduce an option with a hint for the user

:tu# Razor<n>=<hint>
  The Razor-Declaration-Tag introduce the Razor-Tag

:tuR<n>:
  The Razor-Tag must always be used as a pair. When option z<n> is specified,
  everything between the tag-pair is removed

:tu# Colors<n>=<color1> [<color2> <colorN> ...]
:tu# Colors=<color1> [<color2> <colorN> ...]
  As you see there are two kind of Color-Array-Tags available, with and without
  a number suffix, just for convenience. But using more then one without suffix
  will overwrite the previous noted tag. It is treated as if n=1 was used

:tuC<n>:
  The Color-Tag. Where <n> is a number associated to the color at position in
  Color-Array-Tag

:tuNC:
  It's the No-Color-Tag. It's the same as if to note a color as $Normal

:tuDY:
  The Dummy-Tag. Does nothing at all! But it forces an empty line if it appears
  alone in a line. This is particularly useful in conjunction with the Razor-Tag
  to prevent undesirable effects. Make sure in such case that the Razor-Tag cut
  not everything from a line, resulting in a completely empty line.

:tuClearScreen:
  You may have already an idea. It should be, if used, the first tag on an own
  line before any effective content

The usefulness of the following attribute tags is mostly questionable, as the
effects rarely correspond to what they are supposed to do. At least in our use
case. For this reason, those that tend to work are marked with a plus and those
that tend to deliver unexpected results are marked with a minus sign.

  + :tuAB: Bold
  + :tuAF: Faint, decreased intensity, or dim
  + :tuAR: Regular, normal intensity, neither bold nor faint
  - :tuAU: Underscore
  - :tuAu: Neither singly nor doubly underlined
  + :tuAI: Invert or Reverse Video, Swap foreground and background colors
  + :tuAi: Not Invert
  - :tuAK: Blink
  - :tuAk: Turn blinking off
  - :tuDC: Default foreground color
  - :tuDB: Default background color


4-3- Available Colors And Attributes
--------------------------------------
All names must be prefixed by a dollar sign at the Color-Array-Tag, e.g. $Green.

Foreground colors
  Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, White

Background colors
  Are the same as foreground colors but prefixed with 'on', e.g. onRed

Text attributes
  Normal, Bold, Faint, UScore, Blink, Invert


4-4- Notes To Tags
--------------------
- Tags can be expanded with spaces before the end colon, e.g. :tuC1      :
  The idea is to adjust following content with lines above or below for better
  human readability. That's the initial reason of the Dummy-Tag.

- Do not use the characters c or z as an own created option. They are used by
  the Color-Array-Tag resp Razor-Tag.

- An Option-Name-Tag for colors is auto generated when not present.

- Colors and attributes after the Color-Array-Tag can be combined in arbitrary
  order without spaces between. The effective colors are separated by spaces.

- To ensure each color is shown as noted tulizu will prepend each effective
  color with the No-Color-Tag.

- To ensure the following login prompt is not colored use as last color tag the
  No-Color-Tag.

5-2- Issue Escapes
--------------------
See man page of agetty, or the getty you use, below 'ISSUE ESCAPES'.

NOTE: Not all escapes are supported by 'show' command, or only with fake data,
      when you are not using agetty v2.35 or later. See source code for details.

For your convenience, an issue demo file is available, which shows all agetty
escape codes in action.

  $ tulizu list esc.demo show
